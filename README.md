# GridLauncher

## About

This is a very early version of a Grid Launcher based in the old Windows Phone design. It lacks features but it's in a usable state. 
Feel free to open Issues for bug and/or requests. This is a fun side project, so don't expect super fast response times.

## Download

You can find the latest version here: https://github.com/Tgo1014/GridLauncher/releases
